# Descriptive Statistics

Basic set of methods to calculate descriptive statistics in PHP. Stuff that PHP should rather deliver.
This was created in the context of a code kata. Don't use it for calculating statistics in real life. Instead, [use R](http://www.r-project.org/).

Calculation methods:

* mean
* median
* variance
* standard derivation
